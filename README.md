# N-Queen-Solutions
Some very comprehensive solutions to the N-Queens Problem. 

### Added Solution-1 
For a very basic and detailed understanding of the solution of the N-Queens problem.

Drawback: For values of the size of the board>15, the Kernel might take a very long time. 

This is not the most efficient solution out there (wrt time complexity), although it does get the preliminary job done.


#### More Jupyter notebook files coming in soon... stay tuned!
