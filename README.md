# N-Queen-Solutions
Some very comprehensive solutions to the N-Queens Problem. 

### Added Solution-1 
For a very basic and detailed understanding of the solution of the N-Queens problem.  
Drawback: For values of the size of the board>15, the Kernel might take a very long time. </br>
This is not the most efficient solution out there (wrt time complexity), although it does get the preliminary job done.

### Added Solution-2 
For a better and different understanding of the solution of the N-Queens problem.  
This notebook contains two no_conflict() functions. The first one (commented out) is slightly more time-intensive than the second (active).  
Feel free to compile using each of them to notice the difference in time taken for finding the solutions.
Drawback: For values of the size of the board>15, the Kernel might take a very long time. </br>

#### More Jupyter notebook files coming in soon... stay tuned!
