By using a permutation generator, we know that no value in the vector is repeated, so we don't have to check to see if two queens are on the same column. Since rook moves don't need to be checked, we only need to check bishop moves.  \n",

Now all we have to do is make sure that the diagonals for each of the eight queens are distinct.\n",
